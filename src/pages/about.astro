	<h2>Why I Built This Site</h2>
	
	<p>
		If you've ever spent hours trying to navigate Portal das Finanças, wondering if you're filing the right forms or second-guessing whether you really need to pay an accountant for something you could probably do yourself—you're not alone. I've been there.
	</p>

	<p>
		As a freelancer in Portugal, I quickly learned that understanding our obligations to Finanças isn't just about compliance—it's about confidence. Confidence that you're doing things right, that you're not overpaying for services you don't need, and that you can run your business without constant anxiety about tax deadlines and bureaucratic requirements.
	</p>

	<p>
		I built Freelance Guide Portugal because I wished something like it existed when I started. A clear, practical resource that cuts through the complexity and gives you exactly what you need to know—nothing more, nothing less.
	</p>

	<h2>Who This Site Is For</h2>

	<p class="mb-0">
		This site is for <strong>sole traders and freelancers in Portugal</strong> who want to take control of their business administration. Whether you're:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Just starting out and trying to understand what's required of you</li>
		<li>Already established but want to handle more of your reporting yourself</li>
		<li>Tired of paying accountants for simple tasks you could manage on your own</li>
		<li>Looking to better understand Portal das Finanças and your quarterly obligations</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		This resource is designed to help you navigate your responsibilities with clarity and confidence.
	</p>

	<h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

	<p>
		I focus on practical, actionable guidance for the tasks that matter most to independent professionals in Portugal:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Understanding your obligations to Finanças and when they're due</li>
		<li>Step-by-step guides for navigating Portal das Finanças</li>
		<li>Clear explanations of quarterly declarations and annual returns</li>
		<li>Knowing when you can handle things yourself vs. when you need professional help</li>
		<li>Tips for staying organized and avoiding penalties</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		My goal is simple: to help you spend less time worrying about compliance and more time building your business.
	</p>

	<h2>A Note on Professional Advice</h2>

	<p>
		While I share what I've learned from my own experience and research, this site doesn't replace professional accounting or legal advice. Every freelancer's situation is unique, and when in doubt, it's always worth consulting with a qualified accountant or tax advisor. What I offer here is education and guidance to help you understand the landscape and make informed decisions.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you have questions, suggestions, or topics you'd like to see covered, I'd love to hear from you.
