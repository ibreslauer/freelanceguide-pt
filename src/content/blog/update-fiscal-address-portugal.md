Moving to a new address in Portugal? Whether you're relocating within the country or updating your details as a non-resident, keeping your fiscal address current with the Portuguese Tax Authority (**Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira**) is not just important—it's legally required. Here's everything you need to know about updating your address in the Finanças portal.

## Why Updating Your Address Matters

Portuguese law requires taxpayers to keep their fiscal address updated with the Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira (AT). Failure to update it may lead to penalties or fines. Specifically, you have a **maximum of 60 days** to communicate the change to Finanças, and if you don't, you can face a fine between **€75 to €375**.

Beyond avoiding penalties, maintaining an updated address ensures you receive important tax notifications, official correspondence, and documents from the tax authority at the correct location.

## Who Can Update Their Address in Finanças

The process varies depending on your documentation status:

### If you have a Portuguese Cartão de Cidadão (Citizen Card)

- People with Cartão de Cidadão or Bilhete de Identidade **cannot alter their fiscal address directly in Finanças**
- Instead, you must update your address through the Cartão de Cidadão system
- This automatically updates it across all government services including Finanças

### If you don't have a Cartão de Cidadão

- Foreign residents in Portugal who don't have a Cartão de Cidadão can change their fiscal address in the Portal das Finanças or at any Tax Authority office
- This includes non-residents and foreign citizens with a Portuguese NIF

## Step-by-Step Process for Updating Your Address

### Step 1: Submit the Address Change Request

**For users without Cartão de Cidadão:**

#### Access the Portal das Finanças

1. Go to [https://www.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt](https://www.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt)
2. Click **"Iniciar Sessão"** (Start Session)
3. Log in using your NIF (tax number) and password

#### Navigate to the Address Change Form

1. In the search bar, type **"Entregar Pedido de Alteração"**
2. Select **"Entregar pedido de alteracao"** then click **"Aceder"**
3. From the menu on the left, click on **"Morada"**
4. From the dropdown menu on the left, select **"Entregar Pedido de Alteração"**

#### Fill Out the New Address Details

1. Under **"Morada Atual"**, you will see your current address registered with the tax office
2. Scroll down to **"Nova Morada"** and select the country of your new address
3. Click **"Seguinte"** to continue
4. Enter the postal code of the new address and click **"Seguinte"** to go to the next screen
5. Complete all required fields with your new address information
6. Confirm the details and submit the form

**Alternative method**: Some users may access the form directly through [https://sitfiscal.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt/pessoal/morada/alterarMoradaForm](https://sitfiscal.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt/pessoal/morada/alterarMoradaForm), though this redirects to the main authentication portal.

### Step 2: Wait for the Confirmation Letter

Address changes are completed in two stages: first, you communicate the new address to the Tax Administration; second, you confirm the address using the confirmation code from the letter.

- After requesting the address change (online or in person), you will receive a letter at the **new address** within **five business days**
- In Madeira and the Azores, it may take a few more days
- The letter will contain a **unique confirmation code** that you'll need for the next step

⚠️ **Important**: The letter is sent to your **new address**, not your old one. Make sure someone can receive it there.

### Step 3: Confirm Your New Address

Once you receive the letter with the confirmation code:

#### Return to Portal das Finanças

1. Log back into the portal using your credentials

#### Access the Confirmation Service

1. In the search bar, type **"confirmar morada"** and hit enter
2. Select **"Confirmar Morada"** by clicking **"Aceder"**

#### Enter the Confirmation Code

1. Enter the code from the letter under **"Código de confirmação"**
2. Submit the form
3. Your new address is now confirmed in the Finanças Portal

### Step 4: Obtain Your Updated Address Certificate

Once your address change is confirmed, you can obtain official documentation showing your updated fiscal address.

#### Request a Domicílio Fiscal Certificate

1. Search for **"Pedir Certidão"** using the search bar at the top of the page
2. In the main menu, click **"Todos os Serviços"** and scroll to **"Documentos e Certidões"**
3. Choose **"Pedir Certidão"** and select **"Domicílio Fiscal"**
4. Confirm the request and wait until the **"Obter"** button becomes available
5. Click the button to view the certificate and save it to your device

#### Download and Save

1. When the document is displayed, you can print it by right-clicking and selecting print, or use the printer icon
2. To save as PDF, go to the printer icon and select **"Save as PDF"**
3. **This document has no expiration date**

## Important Considerations and Additional Information

### Recent Changes (2025)

Starting **July 1, 2025**, requests for NIF attribution and fiscal address changes for citizens without a Cartão de Cidadão are made through the Portal das Finanças or in person with **prior appointment**.

### Address Changes and Other Implications

Beyond changes resulting from the new address, the address change may also involve changes to:

- District
- Municipality
- Parish
- Finance Service to which the taxpayer is assigned

### For Cartão de Cidadão Holders

If you have a Portuguese Cartão de Cidadão, you must update your address through the citizen card system rather than directly in Finanças. When you change the address on your Cartão de Cidadão, it automatically updates in:

- Registries
- Finanças
- Social Security
- National Health Service
- Electoral Registry

### Document Verification

If you need to verify the authenticity of the certificate:

1. In the Portal das Finanças, follow this path: **"Todos os Serviços > Documentos e Certidões > Validação de Documentos"**
2. Enter the taxpayer number and validation code available in the saved document

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Can't find the confirmation letter?

Make sure it was sent to your new address, not your old one. The system should send it to the new address you specified.

### Code not working?

Double-check that you've entered the confirmation code exactly as it appears in the letter, including any letters and numbers.

### Need help?

You can request support by phone:

- **210 489 010**
- **300 003 990**

Or schedule a video call by selecting the **"Apoio"** option.

### Process taking too long?

Remember that the confirmation letter can take up to five business days to arrive, and longer in Madeira and the Azores.

## Final Thoughts

Updating your address in the Portuguese tax system is a straightforward but essential process. By following these steps carefully and ensuring you complete both the initial request and the confirmation stages, you'll maintain compliance with Portuguese tax law and ensure you continue to receive important correspondence at your correct address.

**Key takeaways**:

- You have **60 days maximum** to update your address or face fines of €75-€375
- Citizens with Cartão de Cidadão must update through that system, not Finanças directly
- The process involves **two stages**: initial request and confirmation with a code
- The confirmation letter is sent to your **new address**
- Keep your Domicílio Fiscal certificate—it's an official document with no expiration date

Remember, this process applies specifically to those without a Portuguese Cartão de Cidadão. If you do have a citizen card, you'll need to update your address through that system instead, which will automatically cascade the change to all relevant government services, including Finanças.
