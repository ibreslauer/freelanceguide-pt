If you work as a freelancer in Portugal under **Recibos Verdes (Green Receipts)**, understanding the difference between **Fatura** and **Fatura-Recibo** is crucial for proper invoicing and tax compliance. These two document types serve different purposes, and using the wrong one can lead to confusion or issues with the Portuguese Tax Authority (**Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira**).

## What Is a Fatura?

A **Fatura (Invoice)** is a document issued to request payment for goods or services you've provided. Here are the key characteristics:

- **Records a transaction** – It documents what was sold or which service was provided, along with the amount due
- **Does NOT confirm payment** – A Fatura simply requests payment; it doesn't indicate whether the client has actually paid
- **Used for deferred payment** – Typically used when payment terms extend beyond the moment of service (e.g., Net 30, Net 60)

### When to Use a Fatura

You should issue a Fatura when:

- Your client will pay you at a later date (not immediately)
- You have payment terms like "payment due within 30 days"
- You need to formally document a transaction before receiving payment
- You're working with larger companies that have structured payment processes

**Example scenario**: You complete a web development project on November 1st, but your client's payment terms are Net 30. You issue a Fatura on November 1st, and the client pays you on December 1st. Once paid, you would then issue a **Recibo** (receipt) to confirm the payment.

## What Is a Fatura-Recibo?

A **Fatura-Recibo (Invoice-Receipt)** is a hybrid document that combines both the invoice and the receipt into one. This is the most commonly used document type for self-employed workers under Recibos Verdes.

Key characteristics:

- **Both invoices AND confirms payment** – It documents the transaction and confirms that payment has been received
- **All-in-one document** – No need for separate invoice and receipt
- **Immediate or near-immediate payment** – Used when the client pays right away or very shortly after service delivery

### When to Use a Fatura-Recibo

You should issue a Fatura-Recibo when:

- Your client pays you immediately or within a few days
- You work on a pay-as-you-go basis
- You want to streamline your invoicing process
- Most small businesses and individual clients pay you promptly

**Example scenario**: You finish a graphic design project on November 1st, and your client transfers the payment to your bank account on November 3rd. You issue a Fatura-Recibo that documents both the service provided and confirms the payment was received.

## Key Differences: Fatura vs Fatura-Recibo

| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

| **Payment Status**     | Payment may be pending                  | Payment has been received                    |
| **When to Use**        | Deferred payment terms                  | Immediate or prompt payment                  |
| **Follow-up Required** | Requires issuing a Recibo after payment | No follow-up needed                          |
| **Common For**         | Corporate clients, long payment terms   | Freelancers, small businesses, prompt payers |

## Why This Matters for Freelancers

As a freelancer under Recibos Verdes, using the correct document type is important for several reasons:

### 1. Tax Compliance

The Portuguese Tax Authority (Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira) tracks your income through these documents. Using the appropriate document type ensures:

- Accurate reporting of when payment was received
- Proper VAT handling (if applicable)
- Clear audit trail for your freelance income

### 2. Simpler Accounting

Most freelancers benefit from using **Fatura-Recibo** because:

- It's a single document instead of two
- Less administrative overhead
- Clearer record of when you actually got paid

### 3. Client Expectations

Different clients may have preferences:

- **Large corporations** often require separate Faturas due to their internal accounting processes
- **Small businesses and individuals** typically prefer the simplicity of Fatura-Recibo

## Practical Tips for Portuguese Freelancers

### Use Fatura-Recibo as Your Default

For most freelance work in Portugal, **Fatura-Recibo is the right choice**. It's simpler, covers both invoicing and payment confirmation, and aligns with how most freelancers operate.

### Switch to Fatura for Extended Payment Terms

If you're working with clients who have formal payment terms (Net 30, Net 60), use a regular Fatura and then issue a Recibo once you receive payment.

### Use Invoicing Software

Don't try to manage this manually. Use one of these options:

- **Portal das Finanças** – The official tax authority portal allows you to generate both Faturas and Faturas-Recibo
- **Third-party tools** – Software like InvoiceXpress, Moloni, or Conta Online can automate this process

### Keep Good Records

Regardless of which document type you use:

- Issue documents promptly
- Keep digital and/or physical copies
- Track payment dates carefully
- Reconcile your invoices with your bank statements regularly

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Issuing a Fatura-Recibo before receiving payment** – This document confirms payment has been made, so only issue it after you've been paid

**Forgetting to issue a Recibo after a Fatura** – If you issue a Fatura and later receive payment, you must follow up with a Recibo to confirm the payment

**Mixing up document types** – Be consistent with your approach and understand when each type applies

## Recibo: The Third Document Type

For completeness, it's worth mentioning **Recibo (Receipt)**:

- Used to confirm payment for a previously issued Fatura
- Does NOT include service details (those are already on the Fatura)
- Simply states: "Payment received for Fatura #XYZ"

**Workflow example**:

1. November 1: Issue **Fatura** #2024-001 for €1,000 (Net 30 terms)
2. December 1: Receive payment of €1,000
3. December 1: Issue **Recibo** #2024-001 referencing Fatura #2024-001

## Quick Decision Guide

Not sure which to use? Ask yourself:

**Has the client already paid or will they pay within a few days?**

- Yes → Use **Fatura-Recibo**
- No → Use **Fatura** (and issue a **Recibo** later when paid)

## Conclusion

Understanding the difference between **Fatura** and **Fatura-Recibo** is fundamental for Portuguese freelancers. For most situations, **Fatura-Recibo** is your best bet—it's simpler, more efficient, and perfectly suited to how most freelance work operates.

The key principle: **use Fatura-Recibo when payment is prompt; use Fatura + Recibo when payment is delayed**.

By using the correct document type, you'll maintain proper compliance with Portuguese tax authorities, simplify your administrative work, and present a professional image to your clients.
