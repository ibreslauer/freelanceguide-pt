If your IRS payment is more than you'd like to handle at once, the Portuguese Tax Authority (**Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira**) allows you to split it into installments directly through the **Portal das Finanças**. This can be a lifesaver for freelancers and self-employed workers who need more time to manage their tax obligations.

Here's a complete step-by-step guide on how to set up an IRS payment plan.

## Step 1: Access the Planos Prestacionais

First, you need to navigate to the payment plan section:

1. Log in to the [Portal das Finanças](https://www.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt)
2. In the search bar or menu, look for **"Planos Prestacionais"**
3. Click on this option to access the installment payment system

**Planos Prestacionais** is the Portuguese Tax Authority's official system for managing installment payment requests.

## Step 2: Start a New Request

Once you're in the Planos Prestacionais section:

1. Look for the section labeled **"Simular/Registar Pedido"** (Simulate/Register Request)
2. Click the **REGISTO** button to start a new installment payment request

This will allow you to create a new payment plan for your outstanding tax obligations.

## Step 3: Choose Your Payment

The system will display all your outstanding tax obligations:

1. Find your IRS payment in the list of debts
2. Click **SIMULAR** next to the IRS payment you want to pay in installments

This simulation feature lets you preview different installment scenarios before committing to a payment plan.

## Step 4: Select the Number of Installments

Now you'll configure your payment plan:

1. Enter your preferred **"Número de Prestações"** (Number of Installments)
2. The system will show you how the payment plan works based on your choice

### Important: The 12-Installment Threshold

The number of installments you choose affects the requirements:

#### **Up to 12 Installments**
- ✅ No additional requirements
- The system immediately shows the monthly breakdown
- Most straightforward option for most freelancers

#### **More Than 12 Installments**
- ⚠️ Requires a **Garantia** (Guarantee)
- You must select a guarantee type such as:
  - **Bank guarantee** (Garantia bancária)
  - **Mortgage** (Hipoteca)
  - **Insurance bond** (Seguro-caução)
  - Other acceptable forms of collateral

For most freelancers, **staying within 12 installments is the simplest option** as it avoids the need for additional guarantees.

## Step 5: Confirm Your Request

Once you're satisfied with the payment plan:

1. Review all the details carefully:
   - Total amount
   - Number of installments
   - Monthly payment amount
   - Due dates
2. Click **REGISTAR PEDIDO** to officially submit your request
3. The system will process your request and confirm your payment plan

You should receive a confirmation that your installment plan has been approved and activated.

## Step 6: Track and Pay on Time

After your plan is approved:

1. Go to **"Pagamentos a Decorrer"** (Ongoing Payments) in the Portal das Finanças
2. Here you can view:
   - All your active installment obligations
   - Due dates for each installment
   - Payment amounts
3. **Make sure each installment is paid before the deadline**

⚠️ **Critical**: Missing even one installment payment can invalidate your entire payment plan, making the full remaining balance due immediately.

## Important Timing Requirements

### Application Deadline

Payment plan requests must typically be submitted within **15 days after the voluntary payment deadline** shown on your IRS notice.

For example:
- If your IRS payment deadline is August 31st
- You have until approximately September 15th to request an installment plan

**Pro tip**: Don't wait until the last minute. Submit your request as soon as you know you'll need a payment plan.

### What Happens If You Miss the Deadline?

If you miss the 15-day window:
- You may still be able to request a payment plan, but it becomes more complicated
- Additional penalties and interest may apply
- You may need to contact the Tax Authority directly

## Benefits of Using Installment Plans

### Better Cash Flow Management
Spreading your IRS payment over several months helps you:
- Maintain working capital for your freelance business
- Avoid depleting your savings all at once
- Plan your finances more effectively

### Avoid Penalties
Setting up an official payment plan means:
- ✅ You remain in good standing with the Tax Authority
- ✅ You avoid additional collection actions
- ✅ You demonstrate responsible tax management

### Interest vs. Penalties
While installment plans do include some interest charges, they're typically much lower than the penalties for:
- Late payment
- Non-payment
- Forced collection actions

## Common Questions

### Can I pay off my installment plan early?
Yes! You can make additional payments or pay off the full balance at any time without penalties.

### What if I can't pay an installment on time?
Contact the Tax Authority immediately. Don't wait until after you've missed a payment. They may be able to help restructure your plan.

### Can I have multiple installment plans active at once?
Yes, you can have payment plans for different tax obligations (e.g., IRS and IVA) running simultaneously.

### Is there a minimum or maximum amount for installment plans?
The minimum and maximum amounts can vary. The Portal das Finanças system will indicate if your request falls within acceptable ranges.

## Practical Tips for Success

### 1. Calculate Your Budget First
Before choosing the number of installments:
- Review your monthly cash flow
- Leave a buffer for unexpected expenses
- Don't stretch yourself too thin

### 2. Set Up Payment Reminders
- Add payment due dates to your calendar
- Set reminders a few days before each deadline
- Consider setting up automatic bank transfers if possible

### 3. Keep Documentation
- Save confirmation of your approved payment plan
- Keep records of each payment made
- Download receipts from the Portal das Finanças

### 4. Monitor Your Plan Regularly
- Check "Pagamentos a Decorrer" monthly
- Verify that your payments have been properly credited
- Watch for any notices or changes to your plan

### 5. Consider 12 Installments or Fewer
Unless absolutely necessary, try to structure your plan within 12 installments to avoid needing a guarantee.

## Alternative Payment Options

If an installment plan doesn't work for your situation, consider:

### SEPA Direct Debit
Set up automatic payments directly from your bank account to ensure you never miss a payment.

### MB Way or Multibanco
Pay directly through Portuguese ATM systems or the MB Way app.

### Bank Transfer
Make manual bank transfers using the reference numbers provided by the Tax Authority.
